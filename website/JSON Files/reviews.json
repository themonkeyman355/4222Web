I don't need this.\r\n(Barry tries to fly away but smashes into the window and falls again)\r\n :\r\nWhat was that?\r\n\r\n(Barry keeps trying to fly out the window but he keeps being knocked back\r\nbecause the window is closed)\r\nMaybe this time. This time. This time.\r\nThis time! This time! This...\r\n :\r\nDrapes!\r\n(Barry taps the glass. He doesn't understand what it is)\r\nThat is diabolical.\r\nKEN:\r\nIt's fantastic. It's got all my special\r\nskills, even my top-ten favorite movies.\r\nANDY:\r\nWhat's number one? Star Wars?\r\nKEN:\r\nNah, I don't go for that...\r\n(Ken makes finger guns and makes \"pew pew pew\" sounds and then stops)\r\n :\r\n...kind of stuff.\r\nBARRY:\r\nNo wonder we shouldn't talk to them.\r\nThey're out of their minds.\r\nKEN:\r\nWhen I leave a job interview, they're\r\nflabbergasted, can't believe what I say.\r\nBARRY:\r\n(Looking at the light on the ceiling)\r\nThere's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.\r\n(Starts flying towards the lightbulb)\r\n :\r\nI don't remember the sun\r\nhaving a big 75 on it.\r\n(Barry hits the lightbulb and falls into the dip on the table that the\r\nhumans are sitting at)\r\nKEN:\r\n\r\nI predicted global warming.\r\n :\r\nI could feel it getting hotter.\r\nAt first I thought it was just me.\r\n(Andy dips a chip into the bowl and scoops up some dip with Barry on it and\r\nis about to put it in his mouth)\r\n :\r\nWait! Stop! Bee!\r\n(Andy drops the chip with Barry in fear and backs away. All the humans\r\nfreak out)\r\n :\r\nStand back. These are winter boots.\r\n(Ken has winter boots on his hands and he is about to smash the bee but\r\nVanessa saves him last second)\r\nVANESSA:\r\nWait!\r\n :\r\nDon't kill him!\r\n(Vanessa puts Barry in a glass to protect him)\r\nKEN:\r\nYou know I'm allergic to them!\r\nThis thing could kill me!\r\nVANESSA:\r\nWhy does his life have\r\nless value than yours?\r\nKEN:\r\nWhy does his life have any less value\r\nthan mine? Is that your statement?\r\nVANESSA:\r\nI'm just saying all life has value. You\r\ndon't know what he's capable of feeling.\r\n(Vanessa picks up Ken's brochure and puts it under the glass so she can\r\ncarry Barry back to the window. Barry looks at Vanessa in amazement)\r\nKEN:\r\n\r\nMy brochure!\r\nVANESSA:\r\nThere you go, little guy.\r\n(Vanessa opens the window and lets Barry out but Barry stays back and is\r\nstill shocked that a human saved his life)\r\nKEN:\r\nI'm not scared of him.\r\nIt's an allergic thing.\r\nVANESSA:\r\nPut that on your resume brochure.\r\nKEN:\r\nMy whole face could puff up.\r\nANDY:\r\nMake it one of your special skills.\r\nKEN:\r\nKnocking someone out\r\nis also a special skill.\r\n(Ken walks to the door)\r\nRight. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.\r\n :\r\n- Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?\r\nVANESSA:\r\n- Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.\r\n :\r\n(Vanessa tries to close door)\r\nKEN==\r\n- You could put carob chips on there.\r\nVANESSA:\r\n- Bye.\r\n(Closes door but Ken opens it again)\r\nKEN:\r\n- Supposed to be less calories.\r\n\r\nVANESSA:\r\n- Bye.\r\n(Closes door)\r\n(Fast forward to the next day, Barry is still inside the house. He flies\r\ninto the kitchen where Vanessa is doing dishes)\r\nBARRY==\r\n(Talking to himself)\r\nI gotta say something.\r\n :\r\nShe saved my life.\r\nI gotta say something.\r\n :\r\nAll right, here it goes.\r\n(Turns back)\r\nNah.\r\n :\r\nWhat would I say?\r\n :\r\nI could really get in trouble.\r\n :\r\nIt's a bee law.\r\nYou're not supposed to talk to a human.\r\n :\r\nI can't believe I'm doing this.\r\n :\r\nI've got to.\r\n(Barry disguises himself as a character on a food can as Vanessa walks by\r\nagain)\r\n :\r\nOh, I can't do it. Come on!\r\n :\r\nNo. Yes. No.\r\n :\r\nDo it. I can't.\r\n\r\n :\r\nHow should I start it?\r\n(Barry strikes a pose and wiggles his eyebrows)\r\n\"You like jazz?\"\r\nNo, that's no good.\r\n(Vanessa is about to walk past Barry)\r\nHere she comes! Speak, you fool!\r\n :\r\n...Hi!\r\n(Vanessa gasps and drops the dishes in fright and notices Barry on the\r\ncounter)\r\n :\r\nI'm sorry.\r\nVANESSA:\r\n- You're talking.\r\nBARRY:\r\n- Yes, I know.\r\nVANESSA:\r\n(Pointing at Barry)\r\nYou're talking!\r\nBARRY:\r\nI'm so sorry.\r\nVANESSA:\r\nNo, it's OK. It's fine.\r\nI know I'm dreaming.\r\n :\r\nBut I don't recall going to bed.\r\nBARRY:\r\nWell, I'm sure this\r\nis very disconcerting.\r\nVANESSA:\r\nThis is a bit of a surprise to me.\r\nI mean, you're a bee!\r\n\r\nBARRY:\r\nI am. And I'm not supposed\r\nto be doing this,\r\n(Pointing to the living room where Ken tried to kill him last night)\r\nbut they were all trying to kill me.\r\n :\r\nAnd if it wasn't for you...\r\n :\r\nI had to thank you.\r\nIt's just how I was raised.\r\n(Vanessa stabs her hand with a fork to test whether she's dreaming or not)\r\n :\r\nThat was a little weird.\r\nVANESSA:\r\n- I'm talking with a bee.\r\nBARRY:\r\n- Yeah.\r\nVANESSA:\r\nI'm talking to a bee.\r\nAnd the bee is talking to me!\r\nBARRY:\r\nI just want to say I'm grateful.\r\nI'll leave now.\r\n(Barry turns to leave)\r\nVANESSA:\r\n- Wait! How did you learn to do that?\r\nBARRY:\r\n(Flying back)\r\n- What?\r\nVANESSA:\r\nThe talking...thing.\r\nBARRY:\r\n\r\nSame way you did, I guess.\r\n\"Mama, Dada, honey.\" You pick it up.\r\nVANESSA:\r\n- That's very funny.\r\nBARRY:\r\n- Yeah.\r\n :\r\nBees are funny. If we didn't laugh,\r\nwe'd cry with what we have to deal with.\r\n :\r\nAnyway...\r\nVANESSA:\r\nCan I...\r\n :\r\n...get you something?\r\nBARRY:\r\n- Like what?\r\nVANESSA:\r\nI don't know. I mean...\r\nI don't know. Coffee?\r\nBARRY:\r\nI don't want to put you out.\r\nVANESSA:\r\nIt's no trouble. It takes two minutes.\r\n :\r\n- It's just coffee.\r\nBARRY:\r\n- I hate to impose.\r\n(Vanessa starts making coffee)\r\nVANESSA:\r\n- Don't be ridiculous!\r\n\r\nBARRY:\r\n- Actually, I would love a cup.\r\nVANESSA:\r\nHey, you want rum cake?\r\nBARRY:\r\n- I shouldn't.\r\nVANESSA:\r\n- Have some.\r\nBARRY:\r\n- No, I can't.\r\nVANESSA:\r\n- Come on!\r\nBARRY:\r\nI'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.\r\nVANESSA:\r\n- Where?\r\nBARRY:\r\n- These stripes don't help.\r\nVANESSA:\r\nYou look great!\r\nBARRY:\r\nI don't know if you know\r\nanything about fashion.\r\n :\r\nAre you all right?\r\nVANESSA:\r\n(Pouring coffee on the floor and missing the cup completely)\r\nNo.\r\n(Flash forward in time. Barry and Vanessa are sitting together at a table\r\non top of the apartment building drinking coffee)\r\n\r\n :\r\nBARRY==\r\nHe's making the tie in the cab\r\nas they're flying up Madison.\r\n :\r\nHe finally gets there.\r\n :\r\nHe runs up the steps into the church.\r\nThe wedding is on.\r\n :\r\nAnd he says, \"Watermelon?\r\nI thought you said Guatemalan.\r\n :\r\nWhy would I marry a watermelon?\"\r\n(Barry laughs but Vanessa looks confused)\r\nVANESSA:\r\nIs that a bee joke?\r\nBARRY:\r\nThat's the kind of stuff we do.\r\nVANESSA:\r\nYeah, different.\r\n :\r\nSo, what are you gonna do, Barry?\r\n(Barry stands on top of a sugar cube floating in his coffee and paddles it\r\naround with a straw like it's a gondola)\r\nBARRY:\r\nAbout work? I don't know.\r\n :\r\nI want to do my part for the hive,\r\nbut I can't do it the way they want.\r\nVANESSA:\r\nI know how you feel.\r\n\r\nBARRY:\r\n- You do?\r\nVANESSA:\r\n- Sure.\r\n :\r\nMy parents wanted me to be a lawyer or\r\na doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.\r\nBARRY:\r\n- Really?\r\nVANESSA:\r\n- My only interest is flowers.\r\nBARRY:\r\nOur new queen was just elected\r\nwith that same campaign slogan.\r\n :\r\nAnyway, if you look...\r\n(Barry points to a tree in the middle of Central Park)\r\n :\r\nThere's my hive right there. See it?\r\nVANESSA:\r\nYou're in Sheep Meadow!\r\nBARRY:\r\nYes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!\r\nVANESSA:\r\nNo way! I know that area.\r\nI lost a toe ring there once.\r\nBARRY:\r\n- Why do girls put rings on their toes?\r\nVANESSA:\r\n- Why not?\r\nBARRY:\r\n\r\n- It's like putting a hat on your knee.\r\nVANESSA:\r\n- Maybe I'll try that.\r\n(A custodian installing a lightbulb looks over at them but to his\r\nperspective it looks like Vanessa is talking to a cup of coffee on the\r\ntable)\r\nCUSTODIAN:\r\n- You all right, ma'am?\r\nVANESSA:\r\n- Oh, yeah. Fine.\r\n :\r\nJust having two cups of coffee!\r\nBARRY:\r\nAnyway, this has been great.\r\nThanks for the coffee.\r\nVANESSA==\r\nYeah, it's no trouble.\r\nBARRY:\r\nSorry I couldn't finish it. If I did,\r\nI'd be up the rest of my life.\r\n(Barry points towards the rum cake)\r\n :\r\nCan I take a piece of this with me?\r\nVANESSA:\r\nSure! Here, have a crumb.\r\n(Vanessa hands Barry a crumb but it is still pretty big for Barry)\r\nBARRY:\r\n- Thanks!\r\nVANESSA:\r\n- Yeah.\r\nBARRY:\r\nAll right. Well, then...\r\nI guess I'll see you around.\r\n\r\n :\r\nOr not.\r\nVANESSA:\r\nOK, Barry...\r\nBARRY:\r\nAnd thank you\r\nso much again... for before.\r\nVANESSA:\r\nOh, that? That was nothing.\r\nBARRY:\r\nWell, not nothing, but... Anyway...\r\n(Vanessa and Barry hold hands, but Vanessa has to hold out a finger because\r\nher hands is to big and Barry holds that)\r\n(The custodian looks over again and it appears Vanessa is laughing at her\r\ncoffee again.
